# FalaMarcelao

The FalaMarcelão App consists of an intuitive interface that takes a sentence or word in Brazilian Portuguese and converts it into images of mouths representing the sounds of each phoneme. The app also offers text-to-speech functionality with speed control, allowing users to adjust the pronunciation speed as needed. For this reason, FalaMarcelão is ideal for patients with aphasia or apraxia who have the ability to write words or short sentences. See below:
